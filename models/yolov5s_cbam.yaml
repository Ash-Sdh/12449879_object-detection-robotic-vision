# Minimal YOLOv5s with one CBAM on top layer (simple demo)
# Ultralytics will load this as a model definition.
backbone:
  - type: yolov5s
head:
  - type: Detect

# Ultralytics doesn't parse arbitrary python modules in YAML directly.
# We'll load CBAM in a custom python hook in scripts/train_cbam.py (below).
